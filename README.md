Without Win32 - programming without windows headers

I wrote code to replicate a minimal amount of Win32 headers for very small programs.  This repository contains that work so that it's not lost to the ether.  There's not much useful here, unless you want to write programs that need the most minimal amount of Win32 necessary to get started.

How to compile something
